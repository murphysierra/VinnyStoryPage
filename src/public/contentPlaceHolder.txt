The Glide
Surfing is the soulful mother of the board-riding experience. It was humankind's first taste of standing on a plank and manipulating its direction with subtle shifts in foot position and body weight. This act was known by the native Hawaiians as the "Sport of the Kings" and held deep cultural stake in the hearts of the Polynesian people. A couple of hundred years down the road skateboarding was spawned by surfers who were so keen for the glide that they wanted to be able to recreate the feeling anywhere, anytime - including on land. I like to think the same is true for snowboarding - the goal is always to find the glide and lose your thoughts.

One common thread in board sports is the inherent lack of a practical application for any of these activities. Maybe you've used your skateboard to move your TV out of your house or your surfboard as a sunshade on the beach, but the purpose of these boards is none other than to have a good time. To facilitate self-expression. A way to play with gravity. A game with no rules and no way to cheat. Board sports have become the prideful champions of subcultural delinquency. Often lopped into the same culturally unacceptable uses of time with graffiti art and punk rock. It's taken a long time for board sports, and snowboarding especially, as the runt of the litter, to catch on. But now that these sports have found cultural acceptance to some degree, we must not forget why it is that we paddled out in the first place.
